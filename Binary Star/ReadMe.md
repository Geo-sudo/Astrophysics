# Binary Star System Simualtion

Ello! This is a (very) basic astrophysical simulation of a binary star system. Did you know that **Sirius** the brightes "star" in the nightsky isn't a star! Yeah, it's a binary star system: two stars that are graviationally bound together ([Read More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_star)). We see it as one source of light because of the massive distance between us and the star; when you look at your LED light bulb you don't see each LED, but you see their light as one.

# Code

The simulation is written in Python using the turtle library, and all the calcualtions are done using math.
